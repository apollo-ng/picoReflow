picoReflow
==========

Turns a Raspberry Pi into a cheap, universal & web-enabled Reflow Oven Controller.
Of course, since it is basically just a robot sensing temperature and controlling
environmental agitators (heating/cooling) you can use it as inspiration / basis
when you're in need of a PID based temperature controller for your project.
Don't forget to share and drop a link, when you do :)

## Hardware

  * Raspberry Pi (Rev 2B)
  * MAX 31855/6675 Cold-Junction K-Type Thermocouple
  * GPIO driven Solid-State-Relays/MOSFETs

## Installation

### Dependencies

We've tried to keep external dependencies to a minimum to make it easily
deployable on any flavor of open-source operating system. If you deploy it
successfully on any other OS, please update this:

#### Currently tested versions

  * greenlet-0.4.2
  * bottle-0.12.4
  * gevent-1.0
  * gevent-websocket-0.9.3

#### Ubuntu/Raspbian

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libevent-dev
    $ sudo pip install ez-setup
    $ sudo pip install greenlet bottle gevent gevent-websocket

#### Gentoo

    $ emerge -av dev-libs/libevent dev-python/pip
    $ pip install ez-setup
    $ pip install greenlet bottle gevent gevent-websocket

#### Raspberry PI deployment

If you want to deploy the code on a PI for production:

    $ pip install RPi.GPIO

This **only applies to non-Raspbian installations**, since Raspbian ships
RPi.GPIO with the default installation.

If you also want to use the in-kernel SPI drivers with a MAX31855 sensor:

    $ sudo pip install Adafruit-MAX31855

### Clone repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/apollo-ng/picoReflow.git
    $ cd picoReflow

## Configuration

All parameters are defined in config.py, just copy the example and review/change to your mind's content.

    $ cp config.py.EXAMPLE config.py

## Usage

### Server Startup

    $ ./picoReflowd.py

### Autostart Server onBoot
If you want the server to autostart on boot, run the following commands

    sudo cp /home/pi/picoReflow/lib/init/reflow /etc/init.d/
    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/reflow
    sudo update-rc.d reflow defaults

### Client Access

Open Browser and goto http://127.0.0.1:8080 (for local development) or the IP
of your PI and the port defined in config.py (default 8080).
